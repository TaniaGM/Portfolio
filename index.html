      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I was born and raised in Canada.  I am a member of the Gitxsan and Tsimshian Nations located in Northern British Columbia.  My Gitxsan Nation is "Lu'al'al'yax.  When translated into English it means, "Talking from the heart/talking from within."  My brothers say it means, "Can't stop talking/Won't shut up."</p>
    
      <p>My hobbies include traveling.  This year we took a Trans-Atlantic cruise to Amsterdam.  The most memorable stop was in Ireland where we rented a car and traveled to the Cliffs of Mohr for the day.</p>
